			<p>Hello there!</p>

			<p>This is a text-based adventure game. You know, the one where you have to read a lot and make choices that will change your outcome. Beware, though: I made this super hard, and there's only ONE positive ending (all the other ones lead to death) so good luck!</p>

			<p>Some things to remember:</p>

			<ul>

				<li>Try not press the back button in your browser.</li>

				<li>Do not cheat and alter the URL!</li>

				<li>Pictures are not owned by me. Sources are provided <a href="source.html">here.</a></li>
