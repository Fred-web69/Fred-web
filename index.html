				<h3>ARTIST STATEMENT</h3>
		
				<br>
		
				<p>Video is something that we see every day, whether it’s on our phones, on the TV, or while browsing the internet. While digital video is excessive and inescapable in the modern world, I believe that video is the best way to convey information, and that is my purpose when creating video. It all comes down to the uniqueness of the video, how engaging it is to be able to attract viewers while still being effective at conveying the meaning. My video work usually takes the form of first-person perspective, giving the audience an immersive experience and placing them in my shoes. While my videos may be serious or abstract, I try to add traces of humor, because humor, in my opinion, is the best way to entertain and grab the audiences’ interest. Through a variety of software, I employ different ways to visualize my perspectives, using sound, special effects, and transitions to enhance my meaning. While my future career is yet to be unveiled, my aim is to animate. Animation, a type of video created using repeated illustrations, has always been an aspiration, and even though I am majoring in Digital Media Art at San Jose State University, I hope what I've learned can be applied in my dream field. In addition, with the convenience of the internet and, of course, video, I am able to learn without the need to enroll or break my bank account. With video, we are able to expand our methods of communication, and my next step of the journey - turning thoughts and my vast imagination into video, is just around the corner. 
</p>

				<br>

				<p>Outside of video, my digital works explore extraordinary ways that digital mediums can be used to surprise and amaze the audience in unexpected ways.  While the term “digital media” is broad and ever-growing, the possibilities are endless as more and more digital mediums are created. Within the infinite possibilities, my work relies on the use of HTML, JavaScript, and other mediums. Spread_game, for example, was an interactive work done in JavaScript to visualize the effects of exponential spread, which I created with the recent COVID-19 pandemic in mind. The project may act like a “seed” for people to do their part, wear masks, and be responsible for others’ safety. I believe that conveying, expressing, and explaining information in a digital sense is key, especially in this modern society, where the “ones and zeroes” become an essential part of not only our lives, but the future of Earth and future generations as well. </p>
