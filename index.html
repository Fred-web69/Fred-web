				<h3>ARTIST STATEMENT</h3>
		
				<br>
		
				<p>Being a digital artist, I am often intrigued with the usage of computers in a continuous and growing range of activities, some being simplified through the use of digital technology, some replaced, or utterly eliminated. For one, artists are relying more on digital drawing tools as compared to traditional ways: Photoshop, Procreate, Adobe Animate, are now the current norms of creating media, with social media (Twitter and Instagram) acting as a public showcase that can be viewed anywhere, anytime. My digital works explore extraordinary ways that digital mediums can be used to communicate, surprise, and amaze the audience in unexpected ways. While technologies are ever-growing, the possibilities are endless as more and more digital mediums are created. Within the wide range of possibilities, my work relies on the use of HTML, JavaScript, Java, and other mediums. <a href="spread_game/index.html">Spread_game</a>, for example, was an interactive work done in JavaScript to visualize the effects of exponential spread, which I created with the recent COVID-19 pandemic in mind. The project may act like a “seed” for people to do their part, wear masks, and be responsible for others’ safety. I believe that conveying, expressing, and explaining information in a digital sense is key, especially in this modern society, where the “ones and zeroes” become an essential part of not only our lives, but the future of Earth and future generations as well.</p>

				<br>

				<p>Outside of coding, my digital works explore the various ways video can be used in unexpected ways to suggest, highlight, or postulate ideas and problems. Because we are all exposed to video every day (I could not spend a day without going on Youtube!), I believe that video is by far the best way for information to reach people. Using Premiere Pro, I create videos along with added effects (such as transitions, sounds, and overlays implemented strategically) with the purpose of making it "outside" the regular expected usage. <a href="photographydemo.html">Photography_demo</a>, for example, goes out of the box to turn a regular, pristine video into a "monetization" horror - the countless and seemingly endless ads in-video ruin the viewer's experience. As someone who works with iMovie, Adobe Premiere Pro, and PowerDirector in my personal time to create short and humorous works, video, to me, is not just a medium of entertainment, it is a way of communication that words cannot express: an extension of language. By learning and utilizing new techniques, I will be able to strengthen my "vocabulary" and amplify the effectiveness of my works.</p>

				<br>

				<p>I expect to continue expanding my knowledge of coding and digital media. In the world of endless possibilities, being able to move the audience through amazement, emotion, and awe is paramount to getting the message out loud and clear, and is my goal as an artist that works with digital technologies. Whether it is by code, video, sound, or something current or hereafter, I crave to persuade the audience about issues, ideas, and concerns that they might have overlooked though various means.</p>
